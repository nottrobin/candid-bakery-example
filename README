Run the server:
    env FLASK_APP=server.py flask run

Run the client:
    python client.py login

(after a first login, macaroons are stored in the filesystem and reused in
next requests, so trying the login command again will hit the server,
verify the macaroons and immediately return with the logged in user
information, without going through candid)
